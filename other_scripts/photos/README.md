Scripts to grab Rebbix website photos and compress them.

Notes:

* Scripts are written using Kotlin with [kScript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript) runner.

* kScript support option to run scripts in IntelliJ IDEA. Check its documentation for this.

* Scripts dependencies are remote. As reserve option in 'libs' folder local jars can be found.

* Compress script works bad for photos from Facebook. Photos compressed by Facebook social network has better quality and size itself.
